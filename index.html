    <!-- Paragraph -->
    <p>Some say that we live in a Gynocracy. In a way it's true. We live alongside the blossoming of technologies like Internet, Radio, TV etc. that spread information far, fast, easily. Maybe this situation allows for whoever is most adept/prolific at manipulation, expression of ideas verbally, visually, in whatever form, to become influential. To harvest resources through a process no different from playing guitar on the side of the road and collecting cash, only reaching many more people. Thus has been born the grifter. Many men are grifters. However woman is a natural grifter because all she has to do in order to collect attention and indeed affection is to be seen by men. So we have female celebrities, internet personalities, and of course onlyfans models. But that's not why people say we live in a Gynocracy. <br>
The power of woman is to divorce a man and take his things, and indeed deprive him of raising his children so that parenting is mostly done by women. No. That's not the power of woman. The power of woman is making children. 'Divorce Rape' is harmful to not only the man but also themselves, not only because they'll lose they evolutionary war, making fewer children. They're also giving up the possibility that their husband stays with them in their old age and makes life as an old lady more bearable. But it is their power OVER MEN, which they use and seem at times to enjoy using. <br>
Though it isn't really the woman doing the divorce who's to blame. If there were no Legal System, Government etc. a mother could not deprive the father from his children, because he could just grab the kid and take him home. The mother would follow. The woman would not be able to take his money or possessions, because he would physically guard them, or retrieve them from her as needed. Man is superior physically to woman. There is no question. So it is really other men depriving the divorced man of what was taken from him. AKA Law Enforcement. Not to mention Lawyers, Intellectuals and Media Workers enforcing stigma, Lawmakers etc. I suspect these are all mostly men. The woman is like a dog running out the door into the street to be hit by a car. They just can't help themselves. <br>
So women are free now and they're enjoying it as best they can I guess. What happens to free things? Somebody takes them. <br>
<br>
How can I say that when I yearn for freedom myself? How can I say they're like animals to be controlled by this or that master? What about men? The same is true of men I'm afraid. There aren't so many free men either. Most have been taken. Some taken by their heart, or their dick. Some taken by an ideology, or a workplace. Some taken by the grim reaper before the age of twenty. It takes a lot to be free when so many people and things are trying to enslave you all the time.</p>
